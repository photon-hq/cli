# Photon CLI

Typed terminal UI for the [Photon Dashboard](https://photon.codes). Replaces the web UI for everyday work — manage projects, Spectrum users / lines / platforms, billing, and your developer profile from a terminal.

```sh
npx @photon-ai/cli login        # try it without installing
bun add -g @photon-ai/cli       # or install for daily use
```

---

## Install

Four options. Pick whichever fits.

### 1. Homebrew (macOS / Linux)

```sh
brew install photon-hq/photon/photon
photon login
```

Auto-updates with `brew upgrade photon`. No runtime dependencies — the formula installs a self-contained binary.

### 2. One-off — no install (`npx` / `bunx`)

```sh
npx  @photon-ai/cli login
bunx @photon-ai/cli projects ls
```

Each invocation pulls the latest release on demand. Good for scripts, throwaway machines, or trying the CLI before committing. Requires Bun on `PATH` (the bundle has a `#!/usr/bin/env bun` shebang) — install it once with:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```

### 3. Global install — daily use (`bun add -g`)

```sh
bun add -g @photon-ai/cli
photon login
```

After install, `photon` is on your `PATH`. The `pho` alias (see below) is created automatically the first time you run `photon`.

### 4. Standalone binary — no Bun, no Node

For CI environments or systems where you don't want any runtime:

```sh
# pick your platform from https://github.com/photon-hq/cli/releases/latest
curl -L -o /usr/local/bin/photon \
  https://github.com/photon-hq/cli/releases/latest/download/photon-darwin-arm64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/photon
photon --version
```

Available for macOS (arm64 / x64) and Linux (x64 / arm64). Each binary ships with a corresponding `.sha256` checksum on the same release page.

---

## Quickstart

```sh
# 1. Log in (opens a browser to approve the device)
photon login

# 2. Pick a project for this shell session
photon projects ls
export PHOTON_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>

# 3. Off you go
photon projects show
photon spectrum users ls
photon billing show
```

### The `pho` alias

`pho` is a shortcut for `photon`, useful for high-frequency commands. It's created automatically as a sibling symlink the first time you run `photon` after installing — so no setup needed for global installs:

```sh
pho ls          # photon projects ls
pho whoami
```

(`npx` / `bunx` users don't get `pho` since they're already typing the full package name; the alias is only created when running through an installed `photon` binary.)

## Concepts

### Backend host

Every command talks to a backend URL. The default — and the only URL baked into the public bundle — is production (`https://app.photon.codes`). To target any other backend (your own deployment, a staging environment, a local dev server), set `PHOTON_API_HOST`:

```sh
export PHOTON_API_HOST=https://your.backend.tld
photon login
photon projects ls

# Or one-off, per command:
photon projects ls --api-host https://your.backend.tld

# Or inline:
PHOTON_API_HOST=https://your.backend.tld photon projects ls
```

Resolution order: `--api-host <url>` flag → `PHOTON_API_HOST` env var → built-in production.

`photon env current` prints the resolved host:

```sh
$ photon env current
production (https://app.photon.codes)
$ PHOTON_API_HOST=http://localhost:3000 photon env current
localhost_3000 (http://localhost:3000)
```

Credentials are stored **per host** (`$PHOTON_CONFIG_DIR/credentials/<key>.json` by default — see [config dir](#config-dir) below — mode 600), so you can be logged into multiple backends simultaneously. The `<key>` is derived from the URL — production keeps the literal name `production` for back-compat; other hosts get a sanitized hostname where `.`, `:`, and `%` are replaced with `_` (e.g. `staging-app_photon_codes`, `localhost_3000`). The `_` substitution avoids collisions between distinct hosts like `a-b.com` and `a.b-com`.

### Setting an active project

Most commands operate on a single project. Two ways to specify it:

```sh
# Per command — explicit, scoped to one invocation
photon spectrum users ls --project abc123

# Per shell — set once, applies to every photon invocation in this shell
export PHOTON_PROJECT_ID='abc123'
photon spectrum users ls
photon projects show
```

Resolution order: `--project <id>` flag → `$PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` → friendly error.

Put `export PHOTON_PROJECT_ID='…'` in your shell rc, or use [`direnv`](https://direnv.net/) to scope it to a directory. Agents and scripts should pass `--project <id>` explicitly per call (or set the env var on the spawn).

**Multi-backend note.** `$PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` is shell-global and single-valued. If you switch `PHOTON_API_HOST` between backends in the same shell, prefer `--project <id>` for the off-default calls, or use a separate shell per backend.

### CI / scripting

Authenticate once locally, copy the token from your credentials file (under `$PHOTON_CONFIG_DIR/credentials/<key>.json`), and use it in CI:

```sh
photon projects ls --token "$PHOTON_TOKEN"
# or
PHOTON_TOKEN=… photon projects ls
```

Pair with `--json` for machine-readable output:

```sh
photon projects ls --json | jq '.[] | .id'
photon billing show --json
```

`PHOTON_TOKEN` reuses the same access token issued by the device flow (default 7d expiry — re-run `photon login` when it expires). A long-lived API-key path is on the roadmap.

## Flags

Only `--debug` is truly **program-level** (works in any position). Every other flag is **per-command** and must come after the subcommand:

```sh
photon --debug projects ls --api-host https://x.tld --json    # ✓ --debug global, others per-cmd
photon --api-host https://x.tld projects ls                   # ✗ won't work (--api-host is per-cmd)
```

| Flag | Env var | Scope | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--debug` | `PHOTON_DEBUG=1` | program | verbose HTTP logs to stderr |
| `--api-host <url>` | `PHOTON_API_HOST` | per-cmd | override the backend URL |
| `-p, --project <id>` | `PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` | per-cmd | project id for this command; defaults to `$PHOTON_PROJECT_ID` |
| `-t, --token <token>` | `PHOTON_TOKEN` | per-cmd | bypass stored creds (CI) |
| `--json` | — | per-cmd | structured output (opt-in) |
| `--yes`, `-y` | — | per-cmd | skip destructive-action confirmation |
| `--no-browser` | — | per-cmd | don't auto-open browser (login, billing, projects open) |
| `--no-color` | `NO_COLOR=1`, `PHOTON_NO_COLOR=1` | program (env-driven) | disable colors (NO_COLOR standard) |

### config dir

The CLI's config root is resolved in this order:

1. `$PHOTON_CONFIG_DIR` (explicit override)
2. `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/photon` (XDG standard)
3. `~/.config/photon/` (default)

If a legacy `~/.config/photon-dashboard/` directory exists from a prior pre-rename install, it migrates automatically to the new path on first run.

Other env vars: `PHOTON_TYPES_SRC` (maintainer-only, for `bun run sync:api`), `PHOTON_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1` (mute update prompt).

---

## Development

```sh
git clone https://github.com/photon-hq/cli
cd cli
bun install

# Run from source
bun run src/index.ts --help

# Watch
bun run dev

# Typecheck
bun run typecheck

# Build (produces dist/photon.js)
bun run build

# Sync API types from a sibling `dashboard` checkout (maintainer)
bun run sync:api
```

The CLI's API contract comes from the `@photon-ai/api-public` type bundle, vendored at `types/api.d.ts`. To refresh after the dashboard's API surface changes, run `bun run sync:api` (looks for the sibling checkout by default; set `PHOTON_TYPES_SRC` to override).

See [`docs/cli-design.md`](docs/cli-design.md) and [`docs/cli-build-plan.md`](docs/cli-build-plan.md) for the full architecture notes.

## Releases

Tagged via PR labels. Add the `release` label to any PR; on merge to `main`, the [Release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yaml) (a thin caller of [`photon-hq/buildspace`'s `typescript-service-release`](https://github.com/photon-hq/buildspace)) generates a version + notes, bumps `package.json`, creates a GitHub Release, and publishes to npm. Standalone binaries are uploaded by [`release-binaries.yaml`](.github/workflows/release-binaries.yaml) on each release.
